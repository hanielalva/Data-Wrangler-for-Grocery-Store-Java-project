# Data-Wrangler-for-Grocery-Store-project
Data Wrangler for Red-Black tree based Grocery Store Java project

This repository displays my work right before integrating with my other project partners. The Java classes were of my own creation. All the interfaces were created by myself and Sreyas Srivastava who was the other Data Wrangler on this project. Sreyas created the XML file too. 

One other java class and interface, that the Grocery Store application depends on to run, have to be omitted from this public repository. This is because they have sensitive code that is against project policy to share.

Each file and each method in these files have detailed comments about their use
